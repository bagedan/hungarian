Challenge #6 Home alone
----------------
You are home, alone, so you order a pizza.

You will pay for it. (With money.)


The task

f(cost: int)

Given the cost of the pizza, calculate the tip and give the money to the delivery guy.

Depending on the amount you say (i.e. print to STDOUT):

:one: if the tip equals 0 or more than 1500 Ft, say I PAID BY CARD KTHXBAI
:two: if you could not possibly pay him just the tip without small coins (<100 Ft), say KEEP THE CHANGE YOU FILTHY ANIMAL
:three: otherwise be a nice guy and say HERE IS amount where amount is the money you pay


Rules

Here is how you calculate the tip:

:one: If the pizza cost less than 2000 Ft, you round up to the nearest hundred.
:two: When cost less than 5000 Ft, you round up to the nearest five hundred.
:three: Otherwise you add 10%, then round to the nearest five hundred or thousand.
> 5100 -> 5650 -> 5500, but 6138 -> 6751 -> 7000

When adding the 10%, you truncate the decimal, instead of rounding it.
> 6138 *1.1 = 6751 and not 6751.8 or 6752


Example Test-Cases
> Note: you submission will be tested using a lot more inputs

1. 100 => PAID BY CARD
2. 15000 => HERE IS 16500
3. 1199 => KEEP THE CHANGE YOU FILTY ANIMAL
4. 6185 => HERE IS 7000
7. 13217 => KEEP THE CHANGE YOU FILTY ANIMAL
8. 11089 => KEEP THE CHANGE YOU FILTY ANIMAL
