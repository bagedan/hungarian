The task*​

```f(input: string)```

Print the characters to `STDOUT` that do not belong. (I.e. characters with the least frequency of a given keyboard row.)

They should be keyboard-ordered (and not input-ordered). Characters created without pressing the SHIFT (asdf etc) should come before SHIFT-ed characters (PI*&" etc.). Each character should be printed once only.


​*Rules*​

Our eight-handed friend has set his keyboard to [International English](http://www.starr.net/is/type/intlchart.html) and uses Windows >8<.
Input will not have white-space, or any characters that cannot with or without pressing SHIFT. (E.e. no international accented chars.)

If there is a tie between two keyboard rows:

:one: print the one with the least amount of unique characters
:two: print the topmost row

1. `FJAFJKLDSKF7JKFDJ` => `7`
2. `ASDFDSASDFDSAzxcPOIUY` => `zxc`
> Chars with least frequency of a given row
3. `qwERfgHJ123456789` => `qwER`
> Topmost row wins; note the ordering
4. `FGhjKL:"';lkqwerzxcc` => `zxc`
> Least amount of unique chars; `zxc` vs. `qwer`
5. `ASDFASDFqwer432!` => `234!`
6. `EUIyouiepIEjhadSDJ(*Y9y9` => `9*(`
7. `1233AERSdfqw` => `123`
8. `ASDF11!*&+1` => `ASDF`
9. `}*3%&2098@$2k234#@$M` => `}`
10. `wqfdSREA3321` => `123`
11. `:X:D:):DDDDDDDxDDDD:(;);];]` => `]`
